There is an array containing some non-negative integers.
Check whether the array is perfect or not.
An array is called perfect if it is first strictly increasing,then constant and finally strictly decreasing.SAny of the three parts can be empty.

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {1, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2}
Output : Yes
The array is perfect as it is first increasing, then constant and finally decreasing.

Input : arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 1}
Output : No
The first part is not strictly increasing

Input : arr[] = {4, 4, 4, 4}
Output : Yes
