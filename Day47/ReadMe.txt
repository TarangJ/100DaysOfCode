Given an array arr(0-based index). The size of the array is given by sizeOfArray. You need to insert an element at given index and print the modified array.

Example 1:

Input:
sizeOfArray = 6
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
index = 5, element = 90
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 90
Explanation: 90 is inserted at index
